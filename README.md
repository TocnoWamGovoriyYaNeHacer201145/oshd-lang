# Why did I create this? 
Yes, I already have two DSL (U#, RANDG), but I wanted to make another one after looking at these programming languages. 
In it, you will have to get out of the habit of the usual print 2+2 to do this: 
```
2 2 + print
```
Not the best, but it will do, also want to show you if/fun 
```
a 10 =
fun test
  4 5 * print
fun_end
if 4 5 <
  aa print
if_end
test
```
And yes, if can sometimes behave strangely, but don't pay attention to that... Oh, I'd also like to show you Hello, world!: 
```
Hello,|world! print
``` 
P.S. I wrote this documentation quite late, I will rewrite it later
